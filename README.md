SOLBET seeks to facilitate P2P speculation and provide trustless on-chain escrow services for speculative ventures utilizing on-chain data, oracle services, and private data node operators to verify outcomes for all parties involved.

The ultimate goal of SOLBET is to allow individuals & communities to safely and securely participate in friendly wagers or anonymous on-chain speculation against others without concern for the trustworthiness of the person(s) holding the assets involved in the speculative venture or if the other party will follow through on their remittance post speculative venture outcome.

The SOLBET Trustless P2P Speculation Protocol was born out of a genuine need amongst active social communities within the cryptocurrency, sports betting, and speculative spaces to encourage participation without worry of mismanaged funds or users possibly backing out speculative ventures engaged in with individuals or communities.
